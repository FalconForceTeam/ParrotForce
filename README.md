# ü¶úParrotForce
Azure playbook for automatic evidence collection.

Current playbook only includes MDE live response for Windows systems.

## Prerequisites
ParrotForce uses connections to Azure Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender to function. The following API permissions need to be present in your managed identity that connects to Azure Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender:
- AdvancedQuery.Read.All
- Alert.Read.All
- File.Read.All
- Machine.CollectForensics
- Machine.LiveResponse

By default, the Logic App of the template is configured on ‚ÄúConsumption‚Äù plan type, hence pricing will only occur upon workflow execution.
